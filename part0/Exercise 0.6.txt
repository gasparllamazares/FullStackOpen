server-->browser: CSS file: main.css
browser->server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/main.js

end note

server-->browser: JSON file: data.json

note over browser:

end note

browser->server: POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa
browser->server: {"content":"New note content","date":"2022-04-03T15:00:00.000Z"}
server-->browser: HTTP 201 Created

note over browser:
Browser receives HTTP 201 Created,
but it doesn't reload the page because
the browser uses the History API to
update the URL and add a new entry to
the browser's history, without reloading
the page.
end note

note over browser:
The SPA is still loaded and the
browser sends only asynchronous HTTP
requests to the server when needed,
without reloading the page.
end note
